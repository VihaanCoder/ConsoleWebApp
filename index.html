        <p>Visual Studio Code is a free source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting,<br> intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.</p>
        <br><br><br><p>Under Windows, the console is always a window that resembles the Command Prompt window. You can open and read and write from/to that thing in your windows program.<br> It's not a buffer or a text file, but you can write a buffer or text file and then transfer that entity to the console.</p>
